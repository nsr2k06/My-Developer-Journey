## üëã Welcome!

Welcome to my central repository for all things C++! This space is dedicated to tracking my progress as I move from understanding the core concepts of the language to applying them in practical, hands-on projects.

This repository is organized into two main sections: **Learning** and **Mini Projects**.

## üìÇ What's Inside?

Here‚Äôs a guide to the structure of this repository. You can explore the sub-folders to see my work.

### 1. [Learning](./Learning/)

This directory is my digital notebook. It contains all my practice code for the foundational concepts of C++. It's where I experiment with and solidify my understanding of the language's building blocks.

### 2. [Mini Projects](./Mini_Projects/)

This is where theory meets practice! This directory holds the small, hands-on projects I've built to apply what I've learned. Each project is self-contained in its own folder, complete with a dedicated `README.md` explaining its purpose and functionality.
