      The last train stood waiting, doors half-closed, lights flickering.
      He hesitated — this train wasn’t on the schedule. A strange silence filled the air.
      Curiosity won. He stepped in.
      The seats were old, and faint whispers echoed through the coach.
      A newspaper on the seat beside him read “Train Missing Since 1985.” 
      His heart froze. He rushed to the door, but it had vanished. 
      The train began to move. Outside, the world blurred — cities fading into shadows. 
      Aarav realized he hadn’t caught a train… he’d boarded a memory.''')
